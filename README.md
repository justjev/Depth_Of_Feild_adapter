This is meant to create a free open source design that will use a few off the shelf lenses and the rest will be 3d printed. I intend to make no money off this project, I simply want an easy to create design that works in conjuction with this 3d printed phone mount by sketchpunk: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1410572

Taking inspiration from the Beastgrip DOF adapter (but more from the now discontinued MK2) : https://beastgrip.com/collections/dof-adapter/products/beastgrip-dof-adapter-mk3 This manual has a visual breakdown and indicates multiple macro lenses are needed https://beastgrip.com/pages/beastgrip-dof-depth-of-field-adapter-user-manual

Partially based from Dora Goodmans 3d printed Advanced Art DOF adapter (which is similar but uses a mount that does not work for all phones and does not support using the correct macro lenses needed for modern iphones)

Her open source files can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sg494rklatG5F5E5yP6nZhJtHTwx40PN  Subfolder GOODMAN_AA_OS

Partially based from baldcour designed Goodman AA to canon ef Adapter https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3735247

Partially based on amats unfinished DOF adapter https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1766725

And amats modified lens mount for the sketchpunk beastgrip https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1775784

And amats follow focus/lens holder kit https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1766649

Parts required:

3D printer (im using a creality ender 3 pro)

Good quality filament, I am using esun pla+ black https://esun3dstore.com/collections/3d-filament/products/esun-pla-1-75mm-3d-filament-1kg-all-colors

A focusing screen (I am using a Canon eons ef D Focusing Screen purchased from ebay) generally any canon ef should fit correctly. It is possible to create a ground glass focusing screen according to https://petapixel.com/2019/12/23/how-to-make-a-ground-glass-focusing-screen-at-home/

Multiple 37mm macro lenses https://a.co/d/7z2yggs
